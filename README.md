my first repository

My name is Frederick "Tommy" Rodgers, and I love learning new things. I studied electrical engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, but the more programming I do, the more I fall in love. I am in the process of learning Ruby on Rails, and it has been a great experience. I want to develop mobile and web applications for fun, and maybe even as a career:).
